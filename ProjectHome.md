Using Javascript with minimum server scripting in ASP to do some funny chess game.

I tried to test it on:
http://www25.brinkster.com/shammoud/chess/

It works only on Microsoft IE. This was years ago when I was trying to learn how to program. So do not expect much out of this web app.


However,I found an open source chess code which works on Google App Engine. It is called "Blitz Chess".

I took the code and added one more game type to it. Then I uploaded the code to my account on GAE.
It took me less than an hour to do this. That is why I love GAE and python language.
I wish I had more time to do the translation properly.

You can try it here:
